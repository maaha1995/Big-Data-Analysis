soaring the first manned mission to the moon blasted off from there in as did the last in so did the first space shuttle mission in and the last in but by with the shuttle program grounded and america half century of space aspirations having ended with bangs and whimpers was rusting away and weeds were growing through its flame trench crippled nasa was eager to sell it the space agency knew there was natural customer elon musk the cheeky paypal co founder and tesla creator whose spacex venture had become the first private rocket company to launch into orbit with payload musk mesmerizing style skittering on the border between visionary and eccentric made it seem at times that his obsession with space travel involved desire to return to some celestial home but his falcon rockets had won nasa respect surprisingly second bidder emerged amazon jeff bezos who pursued his passion for all things including space travel with an awesome talent for being both exuberant and methodical his company blue origin was building reusable launch vehicle that among other things planned to take tourists into space musk won the bidding for launch pad but few months later bezos bought the nearby launch complex from which missions to fly by mars and venus had been launched the transfer of these hallowed pads represented both symbolically and in practice john kennedy torch of space exploration being passed from government to the private sector from once glorious but now sclerotic federal agency to new breed of boyish billionaires who embodied the daring passion and imagination of history great pioneers adventurers and innovators imagetwo new books chronicle this fascinating transition the space barons by christian davenport washington post reporter is an exciting narrative filled with colorful reporting and sharp insights the book sparkles because of davenport access to the main players and his talent for crisp storytelling rocket billionaires by tim fernholz reporter for quartz is not quite as vibrant narrative and lacks some of davenport memorable scenes but it provides smart analysis of the new space sector as well as historical context about nasa triumphs and failures in the class that teach on the history of the digital revolution the students discuss whether innovation is driven more by big government projects or by nimble entrepreneurs the answer of course is that it usually involves symbiotic mix like the semiconductor industry which arose out of the pentagon and nasa need to put guidance systems in the nose cones of rockets vannevar bush was the dean of engineering at the massachusetts institute of technology co founder of raytheon and oversaw the government science programs that resulted in the atom bomb and electronic computer he wrote seminal paper in called science the endless frontier which described how collaboration of all three sectors he had been part of academia business and government would drive innovation government funding of basic research in university labs would lead to discoveries in fundamental science that would be the seed for future inventions many innovations have progressed along that path the eniac computer funded by the united states army and built at the university of pennsylvania was the genesis for univac and then most other electronic computers the network funded by the defense advanced research projects agency and designed by consortium of academic and private labs led eventually to today internet the national science foundation started based on vannevar bush paper created multiagency digital library initiative that funded the academic research of larry page and sergey brin which led to google the sequencing of the human genome largely funded by the national institutes of health planted the seeds for the biotech industry imagenow space endeavors are following this innovation progression as we can call it just as darpa served as the initial impetus for the internet and underwrote lot of the costs of developing the internet in the beginning it may be the case that nasa has essentially done the same thing by spending the money to build sort of fundamental technologies musk said year after launching spacex once we can bring the sort of commercial free enterprise sector into it then we can see the dramatic acceleration that we saw in the internet one of the first private pioneers was burt rutan mutton chopped aircraft designer who regarded nasa as bloated and unimaginative bureaucracy and in founded company called scaled composites that designed aircraft so innovative that as davenport writes it was as if his inspiration came not just from the laws of aerodynamics but from picasso one of his ideas was for manned aircraft that could reach the edge of space and then fold its wings upward to act as feather allowing the craft to re enter the earth atmosphere land on runway and be reused it would become his entry in the ansari prize which offered million for the first private company that could launch reusable vehicle to space twice within two weeks rutan attracted two billionaire partners the first was the microsoft co founder paul allen who as schoolboy in seattle yearned to become an astronaut but being nearsighted realized that was impossible so spent his time coding in the school computer room with his friend bill gates rutan second partner was the toothy goldilocked richard branson thrill addicted serial adventurer and entrepreneur who was as enthusiastic about publicity as allen was averse to it branson personal motto for his company virgin was screw it let do it which was no longer guiding principle at nasa and he created virgin galactic with the goal of taking tourists into space paul isn this better than the best sex you ever had branson asked allen during one test flight as the spaceship climbed higher in rutan craft with virgin logo on its tail flew twice to space and back to win the prize at the celebration rutan took shot at nasa was thinking little bit about that other space agency the big guys he said think they re looking at each other now and saying we re screwed branson began selling tickets at prices that started at to those who wanted to ride in similar plane he began building the launch date of which always seems to be about year away elon musk love of adventure came partly from his maternal grandfather an accomplished amateur pilot in south africa who in completed mile journey across the globe with no electronic instruments musk founded spacex in with the eventual goal of colonizing mars the more musk studied the more he realized that there had been very little advancement in rocket technology in the past years davenport writes to self made silicon valley tech entrepreneur this was stunning his company mantra was set audacious nearly impossible goals and don get dissuaded musk entrepreneurship had social purpose spacex tesla his electric car company and solarcity his renewable energy company fernholz writes were explicitly intended to further human civilization along the way he developed cultlike following when spacex managed to launch space capsule into orbit and dock it at the international space station in something nasa could no longer do on its own the employees at his headquarters broke into chant we love elon bezos was likewise inspired by his own maternal grandfather lawrence preston gise an upright but loving naval commander helped develop the hydrogen bomb during stint at the atomic energy commission and then retired to his sprawling texas ranch to enjoy his family and in particular his insatiably curious little grandson with very big ears smile and laugh bezos passion for space began when he was and he watched with his family the launch of apollo the manned moon mission commanded by neil armstrong it really was seminal moment for me he said remember watching it on our living room tv and the excitement of my parents and my grandparents little kids can pick up that kind of excitement bezos spent every summer at his grandfather ranch where he fixed windmills castrated cattle and geeked out on the tiny county library surprisingly large sci fi collection his high school valedictorian speech was about space how to colonize planets build space hotels and save our fragile planet space the final frontier meet me there he concluded when bezos founded blue origin in naming it after that pale blue planet where humans originated he called upon one of his favorite science fiction writers neal stephenson to be an adviser they kicked around wildly novel ideas such as using bullwhip like device to propel objects into space eventually bezos focused on reusable rockets how is the situation in the year different from stephenson asked him what different is computer sensors cameras software being able to land vertically is the kind of problem that can be addressed by those technologies that existed in that didn exist in bezos began putting together huge tract of ranch land in texas where he could build his reusable rockets in secret one of the great scenes in davenport book is the description of the helicopter trip bezos took to find the land which ended with terrifying crash he survived and it conditioned him to the fact that flying machines sometimes fail among bezos many strengths is to be exuberant patiently to have long term horizon as he has done at amazon at his texas ranch he has begun construction of year clock of the long now designed by the futurist danny hillis which has century hand that advances every hundred years and cuckoo that comes out every millennium in the mission statement for his space company he wrote blue will pursue this long term objective patiently step by step as elon musk pushed forward with very public fits and starts bezos advised his team be the tortoise and not the hare at the end of within month of each other musk and bezos both launched rockets that returned safely to earth and were reusable for the moment musk the hare had darted ahead his powerful falcon rocket had lifted payload into orbit whereas bezos smaller new shepard craft had merely gone up into the edge of space and returned but as happens with scrappy entrepreneurial business competitors in contrast to government bureaucracies bezos and musk were goading each other on and unlike the race between the tortoise and the hare they can both triumph as can one hopes richard branson and others indeed even nasa and its big corporate contractor the united launch alliance venture between lockheed martin and boeing can come out winners from competition as is often the case with the innovation progression the greatest technological advances come when symbiosis is reached

on behalf of individual investors and mr musk had agreed over the last five years tesla has at times been one of the hottest stocks in the market and it has been widely owned by both individual investors and technology enthusiasts as well as institutional investors excited about the long term business prospects for the company since the start of its shares are up more than percent dwarfing the gain of more than percent for the broader standard poor stock index but since peaking in september the shares have slumped by more than percent as concern has grown about ongoing production problems for the model and the prodigious amount of cash the company is burning through many expect that its need for cash will require the company to again turn to markets to raise more capital in

what seemed like his own moat network of supercharger stations around the country that he recently opened up to competitors his initial panning of the moat idea followed question about why he was willing to cede the advantage that the closed charging network provided but in truth mr musk experience and challenges at tesla may demonstrate just how much moat remains powerful deterrent to competitors in the case of the automobile industry perhaps the biggest barrier is the huge amount of capital needed tesla has already raised more than billion but even with huge amounts of money tesla recent production struggles it has repeatedly missed its targets for making the new mass market model show the immense value of manufacturing experience mr musk willingness to challenge convention has

noam chomsky the dead serious linguist and critic of american capitalism and imperialism has had his brushes with the goofier realms of pop culture from an invitation to appear on saturday night live he declined apparently having barely heard of the show to the inevitable simpsons cameo now mr chomsky is the star of perhaps even more unlikely production puppet show manufacturing mischief which will have its premiere run on april and at the massachusetts institute of technology puts mini chomsky onstage alongside elon musk ayn rand and karl marx created by the mexican artist pedro reyes it features zany plot involving technology contest contraption called the print friend and surprise appearance by donald trump there also plenty of high flown debate about technology freedom and inequality the play which was scripted by paul hufker and directed by meghan finn grew out of an artistic residency mr reyes had last fall at mr chomsky longtime intellectual home and place suffused as mr reyes put it with techno optimism has this very beautiful culture of hands on creativity he said in telephone interview but there is also this idea that whatever the problem is the solution is technology we spoke with mr reyes about getting mr chomsky blessing for the project and about the other main characters in his mini drama of big ideas which will travel to carnegie mellon university as part of its marx series from may and to the tank in new york from june noam chomskyimagecreditvincent tullo for the  after arriving at mr reyes met with mr chomsky to float the idea of puppet play

he was pleased with it mr reyes said mr chomsky didn respond to request for comment elon muskimagecreditvincent tullo for the  the show features cameo by an undead steve jobs who pipes up like clueless alexa when character mentions the impact of automation on jobs but the real skewering is reserved for elon musk the tesla and spacex founder who wants to send humans to mars in the play mr musk who in real life has called for government regulation of artificial intelligence even as his start up neuralink aims to build brain computer interface has enlisted mr chomsky as reluctant judge in contest to select the terrifying new gadget which might kill us all to mr reyes mr musk is the kind of visionary who ignores the more basic needs of the broad mass of humanity the very idea of going to mars may capture people imagination but it something that is only accessible to superrich he said there nothing up there anyway mars is kind of boring rock ayn randimagecreditvincent tullo for the  about halfway through the play musk puts copy of atlas shrugged into the print friend and out pops ayn rand wearing the signature dollar sign pin she favored in real life mr reyes read rand novel the fountainhead as teenager but unsurprisingly is not fan though he said he appreciates her theatrical qualities she great character for comedy because she sociopath he said there are so many very crazy things she said karl marximagecreditvincent tullo for the  mr chomsky may be the hero of the play but it karl marx who bats intellectual cleanup with st century rap update of the communist

week news offering analysis and maybe joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry want this newsletter in your inbox sign up here good morning let talk about tech tepid reaction for applethe homepod reviews are in and the verdict is it middling apple smart speaker was originally due to ship last year now after delay and lots of speculation that it would face rough go against amazon echo apple device is finally on sale but most reviewers appraising the device this week suggested that it was best to wait there are some interesting features in homepod but it has long way to go to beat the competition what does it do well it sounds great every reviewer among them nilay patel at the verge joanna stern at the wall street journal and my   colleague brian chen found that homepod beat echo google home and comparable sonos device in audio quality what doesn it do well pretty much everything else reviewers said it expensive versus for an echo it locked into apple music service while competing systems let you play songs from variety of sources and most frustratingly it not very smart where amazon and google devices can answer variety of questions and perform lots of different tasks like order up an uber or lyft homepod brain siri needs evolution brian was particularly upset that the device kept playing music he didn like and for nilay the biggest complaint was that homepod couldn set two timers at once basically table stakes in the smart speaker game none of these are fatal siri is cloud based service which means apple can keep improving it from afar echo too wasn so great to begin with so wouldn count apple out the smart assistant war has barely started intrigue in uber waymo trialtravis kalanick took the stand drank whole lot of water offered his thoughts on greed and google and introduced the world to the crazy lexicon of tech bros unpumped angsty and most mysteriously of all laser is the sauce these are the highlights from waymo big trade secrets lawsuit against uber which after months of legal maneuvering finally hit san francisco courtroom this week kalanick uber co founder and ousted was the first high profile witness to take the stand at the heart of the case is one question did uber steal trade secrets from waymo google self driving car spin off when it purchased otto self driving company founded by former employees of waymo the trial is expected to go on for weeks but early on waymo seemed to score some wins kalanick conceded that during jam sesh with anthony levandowski the former waymo engineer alleged to have stolen its secrets he discussed the key technology at issue in the case laser sensors that apparently when kalanick jotted note that included his conclusion that laser is the sauce it suggested levandowski had convinced kalanick of the importance of waymo tech sure uber lawyers were unpumped about that snap and twitter surprisehere something noteworthy from social media land snap and twitter

chief executive on tuesday that will make him nearly billion if he hits new targets by that on top of the billion gain the electric car pioneer would make on his existing stake mr musk new targets are even more ambitious than the year goals from that he blew through years early the potential value of share grants totaling percent of the company is vast but at least the tesla board has done much more than the usual lip service in setting serious challenge it involves mr musk hitting two sets of metrics first tesla market capitalization has to reach billion more than times its current level and valuation that would be fourth among today publicly listed companies behind apple alphabet and microsoft and just ahead of amazon second he must turbocharge tesla financial performance that requires either growing annual revenue to billion almost times expected top line or making billion in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization figure that may come in at just over million for last year there are steps along the route to the maximum payout reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over million of tesla current and planned vehicles breakingviews calculates that level of sales would be in the same ballpark as bmw and last year total for tesla was barely over vehicles that doesn allow for any surge in the company solar panel and electric storage business which at present contributes single digit percentage to the top line still to get close would require tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as general motors nissan and others ramp up their efforts one model for musk could be amazon whose billion of expected revenue would mark fold increase from founder jeff bezos stock has surged to times its value decade ago yet at the level that mr musk is now aiming for financial incentives can lose meaning with percent stake already worth billion hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money
