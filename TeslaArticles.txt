westinghouse provided funding for tesla induction motors and devices which soon came to dominate manufacturing and urban life unlike the motors of the time tesla motors didn create sparks or require expensive permanent magnets to operate instead they used rotating magnetic field that used power more efficiently in basic design that is still the core of most electric motors in tesla designed the

than in conventional car told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting

autopilot can be substantially more risky than conventional controls there were more than traffic fatalities in the united states last year after investigating fatal crash involving tesla and tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation safety board concluded that autopilot had performed as intended but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology after my drive in the model my sense is that even with its flaws tesla autopilot is vast improvement over conventional controls

scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the massachusetts institute of technology it collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers hands and isn intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years mr reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future self driving automation systems are ranked from zero no automation to full automation tesla autopilot is level it requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel the car issues prompt if it doesn detect hand on the wheel and autopilot shuts down if there no response in the mountain view accident tesla has said the driver received several visual and one audible hands on warning but the driver hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision given that this was my first extended drive using autopilot was hypervigilant maybe even more so than in conventional car told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue as technology supplants human performance mr reimer said the bigger question is how safe is safe enough if lane changing technology is percent more effective than humans is that good enough that the big question no one wants to answer advertisement   the   at the same time he said he worries that intense media coverage of accidents like mountain view will scare people off he said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality but noted that tesla excellent safety record over the many millions of miles

investigating fatal crash involving tesla and tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation

scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the massachusetts institute of technology it collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers hands and isn intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years mr reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future self driving automation systems are ranked from zero no automation to full automation tesla autopilot is level it requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel the car issues prompt if it doesn detect hand on the wheel and autopilot shuts down if there no response in the mountain view accident tesla has said the driver received several visual and one audible hands on warning but the driver hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision given that this was my first extended drive using autopilot was hypervigilant maybe even more so than in conventional car told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue as technology supplants human performance mr reimer said the bigger question is how safe is safe enough if lane changing technology is percent more effective than humans is that good enough that the big question no one wants to answer advertisement   the   at the same time he said he worries that intense media coverage of accidents like mountain view will scare people off he said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality but noted that tesla excellent safety record over the many millions of miles

investigating fatal crash involving tesla and tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation

or fall based on the performance safety design and value of its cars if it gets those things right all the other issues will sort themselves out tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics that includes the model which popular mechanics named its car of the year it was finalist for motor trend similar award that it lost out to the alfa romeo giulia has drawn howls of online protest when my model test vehicle pulled up to the curb on eighth avenue it didn quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull wing doors on the model had but could see why the automotive press is so excited the interior features single slab of wood sweeping

in the synthetic leather seats are comfortable and there ample room for someone my size foot this all comes at cost for this luxurious long range version far from the base price that has excited many potential tesla buyers the model may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the but found it nimble and responsive easily accelerated from full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed usually nerve racking maneuver in conventional car driving the model was such pleasure was reluctant to cede any control to autopilot for someone with decades of experience driving conventional car my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as shock the sensation of vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that instinctively gripped the steering wheel which immediately transferred control back to me this time was more relaxed willing to see how the car would behave gave the voice activated navigation system destination garden state plaza new jersey shopping mall about miles away and the car accelerated braked stayed in the center of the lane and maintained comfortable three car distance ahead of me all without my intervention at the mall it detected an empty parking place and flawlessly backed into it one of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn signal lever the tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane waits for an opening and then glides into place eliminating the danger of blind spot over the years ve experienced several close calls involving lane changes and blind spots although been briefed on its limitations so successful was autopilot that was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror that would have been mistake for all its vision capabilities including in darkness autopilot became confused when lanes weren clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps you can simply program the destination and let the car find its way it reassuringly cautious about changing lanes but in heavy traffic would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find suitable opening and had to assert manual control while heading south on the new jersey turnpike could see in the rearview mirror bmw bearing down at high speed pushed the turn signal for lane change and despite its ultrasonic sensors the tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car it started to move into its lane the driver laid on his horn and had to grab control to avoid an accident blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue the tesla owner manual describes this situation as one that the system can yet manage tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem but for now drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car tesla had no comment for this column at this juncture autopilot is misnomer as many others have observed this is not self driving technology said bryan reimer research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the massachusetts institute of technology it collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers hands and isn intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years mr reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future self driving automation systems are ranked from zero no automation to full automation tesla autopilot is level it requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel the car issues prompt if it doesn detect hand on the wheel and autopilot shuts down if there no response in the mountain view accident tesla has said the driver received several visual and one audible hands on warning but the driver hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision given that this was my first extended drive using autopilot was hypervigilant maybe even more so than in conventional car told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue as technology supplants human performance mr reimer said the bigger question is how safe is safe enough if lane changing technology is percent more effective than humans is that good enough that the big question no one wants to answer at the same time he said he worries that intense media coverage of accidents like mountain view will scare people off he said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality but noted that tesla excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using autopilot can be substantially more risky than conventional controls there were more than traffic fatalities in the united states last year after investigating fatal crash involving tesla and tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation safety board concluded that autopilot had performed as intended but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology after my drive in the model my sense is that even with its flaws tesla autopilot is vast improvement over conventional controls and enhances rather than supplants the driving experience tempted to join the model waiting list which numbers over customers investors too seem to have reassessed tesla recent

usually refers to software still in the developmental stage advertisement   the   at the time of the florida crash it was possible to engage autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel in that crash the autopilot camera then the primary sensor in the system failed to recognize white truck as it was crossing rural highway tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against bright sky software modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel after three warnings the new software prevents autopilot from operating until the driver stops turns off the car and restarts the new version also made radar the primary sensor and mr musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the florida crash despite the bright sky autopilot does not use lidar kind of radar based on lasers that waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles mr musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for autopilot to be safe at least three people have now died while driving with autopilot engaged in january chinese owner

electric mission cross turismo global automakers are rolling out more electric vehicles as they try to challenge tesla and get ahead of looming shifts in transportation creditporscheby tom voelkmarch tesla has practically had the market for pavement scorching long range electric vehicles all to itself but consumers will soon have lot more choices to compare with the model sedan and its sport utility sibling the model and those offerings will be coming from established luxury brands that will be able to take advantage of tax breaks just as they start to run out for the segment dominant brand and if there target on tesla back it might be porsche that has elon musk company most firmly in its sights porsche has already shown off an all electric sedan the mission which is expected to compete with tesla model and at the geneva international motor show on tuesday porsche made surprise reveal of crossover concept variant the mission cross turismo which looks very much like rival to the model but the german automaker isn going to compete with tesla just on the street by turning out line of electric cars that it insists will be unmistakably porsche it also ramping up its answer to tesla supercharger stations mission vehicles will be capable of volt charging that offers miles in minutes step above the volt supercharger systems which supply up to miles of travel in half hour and porsche wants to provide the technology to top off its mission cars too one of our priorities will be to equip our dealerships with volt dc fast chargers said klaus zellmer president and chief executive of porsche cars north america we have just installed six at our porsche experience centers in atlanta and will roll them out at our experience center in los angeles too as part of its settlement with the california air resources board and the united states environmental protection agency over its diesel emission test cheating volkswagen porsche parent company is also building

the other half of this two pronged approach although it is officially concept vehicle it is expected to be an accurate preview of what buyers will see from porsche after the mission vehicles go into production next year while no pricing has been announced the sedan version could run close to the existing panamera which begins at compared with the base price of tesla model the mission vehicles are hardly alone in jockeying for position in the premium electric market last week jaguar unveiled the production version of its fully electric pace crossover which is scheduled to glide into showrooms in the second half of the jaguar pace the carmaker first electric vehicle will start at in the united states tesla model starts at audi has announced it will ship its tron quattro to european showrooms this fall and to the united states in early and volvo plans an all electric version of its xc crossover in porsche jaguar audi and other long established carmakers have watched as tesla has sprinted ahead but tesla will soon lose one crucial benefit that the later arrivals may be able to use to close the gap tax benefits at some point this year tesla will produce its th car general motors which makes the chevrolet bolt ev and volt electric vehicles will most likely reach that mark in too at that milestone federal tax credits will begin to phase out it not clear whether the new upscale choices will hurt tesla or simply expand the segment dave guilford managing editor for crain automotive news suggested that it probably little bit of both you could see when porsche unveiled the mission it was aiming right at tesla he said it beautiful car new entries in the premium segment give it credibility the wagonlike all wheel drive cross turismo could be compelling alternative to the model its kilowatt system uses two permanent synchronous electric motors and floor mounted lithium ion battery pack that porsche claims will propel the cross turismo to miles per hour in seconds it will also employ an air suspension that can add nearly two inches of ground clearance and rear wheel steering that will help it in the corners at feet long the cross turismo concept is about four inches shorter than the company macan crossover and inches shorter than tesla model the concept interior features free standing instrument cluster screen with three circular display graphics camera

same off the line performance of the teslas model in ludicrous mode catapults to in about seconds porsche believes that its decades of racing experience will ensure better high performance experience for example when tesla is put into ludicrous mode drivers are warned of the possibility of accelerated wear of the motor gearbox and battery and teslas will sometimes enter reduced power mode under track conditions in order to protect the battery from overheating porsche intends to avoid such limitations said albrecht reimold member of the porsche executive board for production even when it is electrified the powertrain remains distinguishing feature for porsche he said the carmaker had plenty of ideas for offering the typical porsche dna to its electric customers mr reimold said high continuous output acceleration reserves and reproducibility with power takeoff are essential features of porsche electric motors he said tesla still boasts many advantages the free charging for many of its customers through its station charging network is security blanket for long distance travelers and its customers continue to be enthusiastic brand ambassadors but it has shown some vulnerabilities tesla has had trouble meeting its production goals for the model the most affordable entry in its lineup there have also been quality issues consumer reports ranked the model among the least reliable vehicles in its survey and there have been well documented fit and finish problems that has provided an opening not just for the luxury carmakers but for the rest of the industry to join general motors and nissan which makes the leaf electric vehicle in challenging tesla model hyundai for example has confirmed plans for fully electric kona crossover and buick is rumored to be gaining small crossover based on the chevy bolt platform tesla may have created new automotive segment and single handedly made the electric car cool with blistering performance high technology and
